Copying, moving and deleting files
To copy  press yy, 
to paste it, instead, we can press p.
To move files, what we do is pressing dd to “cut” them, 
and then p to paste them in the appropriate place.
 Finally, do delete a file, we press dD. 
All of these actions can also be accomplished by running the appropriate commands: copy, paste, rename <newname> and delete, respectively.
